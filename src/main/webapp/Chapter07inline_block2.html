			O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br>What so
			proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br> Whose
			broad stripes and bright stars,<br> through the perilous fight,<br>
			O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?<br>
			And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br> Gave
			proof through the night that our flag was still there;<br> O
			say, does that star-spangled banner<br> yet wave O’er the land
			of the free and the home of the brave!
		</p>
		<p>
			On the shore, dimly seen thro’ the mist of the deep,<br> Where
			the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br> What is
			that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,<br> As it
			fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br> Now it
			catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, In full glory
			reflected,<br> now shines on the stream ’Tis the star-spangled
			banner.<br> Oh! long may it wave O’er the land of the free and
			the home of the brave!
		</p>
		<p>
			And where is that band who so vauntingly swore <br>That the
			havoc of war and the battle’s confusion <br>A home and a country
			should leave us no more?<br> Their blood has washed out their
			foul footstep’s pollution.<br> No refuge could save the hireling<br>
			and slave From the terror of flight,<br> or the gloom of the
			grave,<br> And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br>
			O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh! thus be it ever,<br> when freemen shall stand Between their
			loved homes and the war’s desolation,<br> Blest with vict’ry and
			peace,<br> may the Heav’n rescued land<br> Praise the Pow’r
			that hath made <br>and preserved us a nation!<br> Then
			conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br> And this be our
			motto: "In God is our trust."<br> And the star-spangled banner<br>
			in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the
			brave
